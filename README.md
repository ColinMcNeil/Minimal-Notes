<h1 align="center">Minimal Notes</h1>

<p align="center"> Simple Notes web app build with Vue.js made for PC or Tablet </p>

<hr/>

<p> There are many notes apps, but I needed something simple that works for me on my laptop. That is why I made minimal notes that will work in my browser locally. Everything is stored in your web browser localStorage. All the coding is done with Vue.js and the best part is everything is in the index.html file that is only 4Kb. </p>
